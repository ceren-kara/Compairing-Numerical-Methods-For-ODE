# Numerical-Methods-For-ODEs


Differential equations are among the most important mathematical tools used in producing models in the physical sciences, biological sciences, and engineering. 

An Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is an equation that contains a function having one independent variable:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)">

The equation is coupled with an initial value/condition 


<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE y(x_0) = y_0, \ x \geq x_0 ">


(i.e., value  of y at <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x = x_0">) 

Such equation is called **Initial Value Problem (IVP)**. Our goal is approximate the solution of the problem. Here **f** is sufficiently well-behaved function that maps <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=[x_0 , \infty) \times \mathbb{R}^d $ to $ \mathbb{R}^d "> and the initial condition 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d"> is a given vector.(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbb{R}^d "> denotes the *d*-dimentional real Euclidean space.)

In this project, we consider numerical methods for solving Ordinary Differential Equations.
